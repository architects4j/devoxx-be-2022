# About this workshop

The persistence mechanism is the heart of most applications and microservices, although architects often happen not to give as much attention to such components. A wrong choice and design, will impact the whole system's functioning, no matter how much you scale up the service. Join this session and learn how to avoid this from happening.

In this guided lab, you'll learn tips and tricks on creating a healthier app with an increased performance by improving its relation with database persistence.

From a Java perspective, you'll try not only more conventional options like SQL and NoSQL but also some trendy new solutions in the market like MicroStream. You'll also have hands-on experience with this open-source ultrafast in-memory data persistence storage allows queries to be up to 1000x times faster than traditional relational databases.
